2025-07-23 20:07:51.218744,Reddit,F,"23k profit from OPEN shares I followed the DD on OPEN back when the price was sub $1 and saw the post about the stock hitting 500M MC, kept my eye on it and pulled the trigger Friday with money I could afford to lose. I was around during all those meme stocks awhile back and saw the same tale tell signs, this was not going to be a long term position. What I learned during the meme frenzy was that once you start seeing the majority of the comments start talking about diamond hands this and that, is when you should start taking your profits. 

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order. The second sell order was a market stop I initiated once the stock fell and got halted, and then it sold at $3.11, pocketing a cool $23k. Obviously I was hoping for more, but as soon as I saw that drop and halt, I was out."

2025-07-23 20:07:51.218946,Reddit,F,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away. 

Goodluck & NFA"

This could have major implications for the company involved (not naming the ticker here, but it may become obvious if you're following the space).

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel

2025-07-23 20:07:51.219484,Reddit,F,"$NTCPF about to go to the stratosphere? 6-12 months if your patient enough. After a beautiful presentation today Northisle Copper and Gold offered some great insight on their project.

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."
2025-07-23 20:07:51.219614,Reddit,AI,"$NTCPF about to go to the stratosphere? 6-12 months if your patient enough. After a beautiful presentation today Northisle Copper and Gold offered some great insight on their project.

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

A signed Letter of Intent with the world’s largest fumed silica producer highlights industry confidence and commercial interest
Interest from additional potential partners is growing
Phase 2 testing begins in August, with expectations of producing commercial-grade material in just one or two production runs
Discussions around long-term offtake agreements are expected to accelerate once consistent commercial-grade output is achieved


DISRUPTING A LEGACY INDUSTRY
HPQ Silicon is advancing a breakthrough process for manufacturing fumed silica, an essential material used in cosmetics, toothpaste, food additives, and industrial products. 
Traditional production methods, unchanged since 1944, are costly, fossil-fuel intensive, and environmentally harmful. HPQ’s proprietary approach promises a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially superior alternative.

INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMS PROGRESS
Recent production tests delivered a major leap forward, validated by independent analysis from a lab serving global fumed silica manufacturers. These results confirm HPQ’s material is within reach of commercial-grade output.

“Independent analysis confirms we are very close to commercial-grade material. It’s not just progress—it’s a leap forward,” said Bernard Tourillon, CEO of HPQ Silicon.

OUTLOOK
HPQ is on the verge of commercial viability for its fumed silica process while setting its sights on exceeding conventional product performance.

2025-07-23 20:07:51.219952,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

2025-07-23 20:07:51.220188,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy. Actual science, major unmet need, catalyst clock ticking, and no retail hype yet. Could be one of those plays we all wish we loaded before it ran."

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy. Actual science, major unmet need, catalyst clock ticking, and no retail hype yet. Could be one of those plays we all wish we loaded before it ran."

Quick recap: In early 2023, Allovir was accused by independent monitors of hiding that Allovir’s Phase 3 trials for posoleucel were unlikely to succeed. When the company terminated all three trials and revealed the negative results in December 2023, $ALVR fell by over 67%. By March 2024, Allovir faced a lawsuit from investors.



Now they’re paying them a $1M settlement. And the deadline is next month, August 19. So, if you were damaged by this, you can [check if you’re eligible](https://11th.com/cases/allovir-investor-settlement) and file a claim to get payment.



Anyways, did anyone here invest in $ALVR back then? How much were your losses if so?"

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news  
• Potential buyout bait if Phase 3 is confirmed  
• No major dilution or debt issues (check the filings"

**MIAMI, FL /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ July 23, 2025 / Star8 Corporation (OTC:STRH)**, a leading technology group specializing in energy-efficient solutions and electric vehicles, is poised for transformative growth over the next 24 to 36 months, driven by its revolutionary Tomahawk DualTech System and scaled electric motorcycle production.

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**. This approach targets sectors with massive electricity requirements, including **data centers, manufacturing plants, industrial refrigeration, mining operations**, and **large-scale logistics facilities**, positioning Star8 to disrupt the global energy efficiency market.

The company is in the process of completing an ‘active' demonstration test unit that will be available for the market and any potential clients to see in ‘real-time' the incredible efficiency and cost-saving potential of implementing this technology.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

If by tomorrow night I am alive the plan is the same next morning. To all the traders out there struggling with what ever part of this game, know that this shit is literally going face to face with your own demons, addictions and behavior that actually doesn’t let you grow being fear and green the big bosses… and defeat those demons is the biggest challenge because they appear daily, but! each time you win that day by following what you said you was going to the demons become weaker, keep winning.

Huh now reading this I guess I got I little exited lol but what I wanna to ask was if someone had a situation like that, that even knowing you can do it laziness wins and what was the click their did in their mind to change that? To me was the finding out what I really wanted from life, nothing material just to be the best I can each day

I have no idea why you guys are so divisive on pretty agreed upon things in the industry side of things. 

Like I've met institutional traders who literally only use trendlines (including myself, but I'm not an institutional trader) and yet redditors will lie and go 'the bAnKs don't trade with trendlines'. Like yes they fucking do wtf? Why do you guys do this?

Not only that, reddit just pumps the worst stocks lmao. Like just this week alone, OPEN and rkt were complete disasters lmao. I'm under the impression that there's no actual good traders on the entire website at all."

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

I have Spent DAYS and DAYS watching charts and researching.  Just like you have no doubt.  I have made every Mistake, just like you have,  I still make them daily even though I know what they are.  I have learned so much from shared experiences and knowing that I will, or I have experienced the same challenges.  Quick share. I took 5k first week going live and crashed it to $900.

I use Tradovate/NinjaTrader same thing.  I feel comfortable getting a good entry and following with my stop losses until I've reached my goal then walking away.  No problem, right?  Profits are Locked, Right?

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Here is my Problem.  If I am in say 15 Micro on MGC, set my STOP and LIMIT for 15 right..If I hit the LIMIT I take profit all is good right?  Until it comes back up/down and hit the stop loss.  Then it BUYS/SELLS 15!!!  That could get really bad!  AM I stupid and missing something that is extremely simple and obvious to prevent this?"

I treated it like Fun and when I got bored I would go aggressive.  Now. I just stay bored and pick cherries and when I get My $300 a day I have to FORCE myself to STOP!!

I use Tradovate/NinjaTrader same thing.  I feel comfortable getting a good entry and following with my stop losses until I've reached my goal then walking away.  No problem, right?  Profits are Locked, Right?

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Here is my Problem.  If I am in say 15 Micro on MGC, set my STOP and LIMIT for 15 right..If I hit the LIMIT I take profit all is good right?  Until it comes back up/down and hit the stop loss.  Then it BUYS/SELLS 15!!!  That could get really bad!  AM I stupid and missing something that is extremely simple and obvious to prevent this?"

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

2025-07-23 20:07:51.223956,Reddit,F,"Chipotle trims same-store sales forecast as fewer diners visit its restaurants Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday cut its forecast for same-store sales growth this year after traffic declined for a second straight quarter.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

I was around during all those meme stocks awhile back and saw the same tale tell signs, this was not going to be a long term position. What I learned during the meme frenzy was that once you start seeing the majority of the comments start talking about diamond hands this and that, is when you should start taking your profits. 

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order. The second sell order was a market stop I initiated once the stock fell and got halted, and then it sold at $3.11, pocketing a cool $23k.

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away. 

Goodluck & NFA"

I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away. 

Goodluck & NFA"
2025-07-23 20:08:57.064138,Reddit,F,"IVF stock… Provider Allegedly Destroyed Embryos Using Toxic Chemical — Lawsuit Filed Just read a breaking story on ABC News: A group of couples have filed a lawsuit against an IVF provider, alleging their embryos were destroyed after being exposed to hydrogen peroxide — a chemical that can be toxic to cells. According to the report, the plaintiffs claim the fertility lab used the solution in error, which resulted in the loss of viable embryos.

This could have major implications for the company involved (not naming the ticker here, but it may become obvious if you're following the space). If you're an investor in the fertility/biotech space, or just following developments in the IVF sector, this is worth watching closely — both from a legal and reputational standpoint.

Would love to hear thoughts on how this might impact the broader IVF market, regulations, or even investor confidence in these types of stocks."

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

2025-07-23 20:08:57.064787,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

2025-07-23 20:08:57.064871,Reddit,AI,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.

2025-07-23 20:08:57.064979,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy.

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

Historically, this level signals major risk repricing and liquidity drains.

* March 2020 (liquidity crisis)
* Aug 2011 (US downgrade)
* Late 2008 (no explanation needed)

The bond market is screaming, equities aren't listening yet. Classic ""something's about to give""

Gold & PMs holding strong, options flow into PMs is scarily bullish. The money has to go somewhere.....

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

2025-07-23 20:08:57.067767,Reddit,TSLA,"Tesla's Q2 Results: The Affordable EV & Robotaxi  What's Next for TSLA? Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

I’m aware that beating the market is difficult, but I choose individual stocks for fun.

Now, I’m looking to add about €2,000 a month and want to diversify a bit more. I realize that VOO is very tech-heavy due to its top holdings, and my hand-picked stocks are also concentrated in tech. Additionally, my portfolio is very U.S.-centric, which has been feeling a bit risky lately. I’m wondering what the more experienced investors on here would recommend in terms of diversification.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

2025-07-23 20:08:57.068452,Reddit,F,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

AT&T expects to continue investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjust its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth.

Net Income
On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported a net income of $4.46 billion or 62 cents per share compared with $3.55 billion or 49 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement was primarily attributable to higher contributions from the DIRECTV investments during the quarter.

2025-07-23 20:08:57.069188,Reddit,F,"SGLN (gold ETF) and VWRP (all-world) ETF Please, can I get some advice regarding how good/bad these two can be as the only instruments used for a long term investment (10 years or so).

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

What would you do? Thank you so much."

I was around during all those meme stocks awhile back and saw the same tale tell signs, this was not going to be a long term position. What I learned during the meme frenzy was that once you start seeing the majority of the comments start talking about diamond hands this and that, is when you should start taking your profits. 

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order. The second sell order was a market stop I initiated once the stock fell and got halted, and then it sold at $3.11, pocketing a cool $23k. Obviously I was hoping for more, but as soon as I saw that drop and halt, I was out."

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away.

2025-07-23 20:10:02.484357,Reddit,F,"$NTCPF about to go to the stratosphere? 6-12 months if your patient enough. After a beautiful presentation today Northisle Copper and Gold offered some great insight on their project.

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

A signed Letter of Intent with the world’s largest fumed silica producer highlights industry confidence and commercial interest
Interest from additional potential partners is growing
Phase 2 testing begins in August, with expectations of producing commercial-grade material in just one or two production runs
Discussions around long-term offtake agreements are expected to accelerate once consistent commercial-grade output is achieved


DISRUPTING A LEGACY INDUSTRY
HPQ Silicon is advancing a breakthrough process for manufacturing fumed silica, an essential material used in cosmetics, toothpaste, food additives, and industrial products. 
Traditional production methods, unchanged since 1944, are costly, fossil-fuel intensive, and environmentally harmful. HPQ’s proprietary approach promises a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially superior alternative.

INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMS PROGRESS
Recent production tests delivered a major leap forward, validated by independent analysis from a lab serving global fumed silica manufacturers. These results confirm HPQ’s material is within reach of commercial-grade output.

“Independent analysis confirms we are very close to commercial-grade material. It’s not just progress—it’s a leap forward,” said Bernard Tourillon, CEO of HPQ Silicon.

2025-07-23 20:10:02.484805,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

2025-07-23 20:10:02.485026,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy. Actual science, major unmet need, catalyst clock ticking, and no retail hype yet. Could be one of those plays we all wish we loaded before it ran."

Quick recap: In early 2023, Allovir was accused by independent monitors of hiding that Allovir’s Phase 3 trials for posoleucel were unlikely to succeed. When the company terminated all three trials and revealed the negative results in December 2023, $ALVR fell by over 67%. By March 2024, Allovir faced a lawsuit from investors.



Now they’re paying them a $1M settlement. And the deadline is next month, August 19. So, if you were damaged by this, you can [check if you’re eligible](https://11th.com/cases/allovir-investor-settlement) and file a claim to get payment.



Anyways, did anyone here invest in $ALVR back then? How much were your losses if so?"

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

⸻

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy."

FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news  
• Potential buyout bait if Phase 3 is confirmed

**MIAMI, FL /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ July 23, 2025 / Star8 Corporation (OTC:STRH)**, a leading technology group specializing in energy-efficient solutions and electric vehicles, is poised for transformative growth over the next 24 to 36 months, driven by its revolutionary Tomahawk DualTech System and scaled electric motorcycle production.

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**. This approach targets sectors with massive electricity requirements, including **data centers, manufacturing plants, industrial refrigeration, mining operations**, and **large-scale logistics facilities**, positioning Star8 to disrupt the global energy efficiency market.

The company is in the process of completing an ‘active' demonstration test unit that will be available for the market and any potential clients to see in ‘real-time' the incredible efficiency and cost-saving potential of implementing this technology.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

Hey everyone, I’m very new to this and just started studying about 2 months ago and haven’t even gotten to enough knowledge to trade demo yet. That said, I have every intention to keep learning and eventually back test and trade demo even if it takes years to become profitable. I’m not concerned about the time frame. My main question is: am I wasting my time watching TJR to start out? I hear a lot of mixed opinions and want to see what concepts you all trade with  or recommend learning first before I put all my faith into TJR/ICT concepts.

Different contracts would be the likely thought, but it’s the middle of july and contract roll over was a while ago. I included two charts one from a couple days ago and one from tonight and you can see on the first one the ath price is around 46000 but today it shows ym made a new high. Both charts are from trading view. I remember something like this happened when es made its ath last month tho that one could’ve been contract based.

Like I've met institutional traders who literally only use trendlines (including myself, but I'm not an institutional trader) and yet redditors will lie and go 'the bAnKs don't trade with trendlines'. Like yes they fucking do wtf? Why do you guys do this?

Not only that, reddit just pumps the worst stocks lmao. Like just this week alone, OPEN and rkt were complete disasters lmao. I'm under the impression that there's no actual good traders on the entire website at all."

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

2025-07-23 20:10:02.487487,Reddit,F,"Stop and Limit Advice First time posting. First time trading. Hell, First time on Reddit. 3 months now I've dedicated to Trading. I've scrolled through this Sub a Lot and learned quit a bit from the ones that are gracious enough to share and have learned very well how to weed through the B.S.  I worked very Labor intensive and long hours in Heavy Equipment earth moving industry as a Cat Tech for 25 years and have always had a knack for predicting economical future moves with out even analyzing technical data. I have always been intrigued with the markets and how they work.  I am at a point in life I can take the time to learn.  YouTube is where I started of course.  I also learned how to sort through the B.S. there. (WTH is wrong with people and their misguidance and LOW moral concept?)  different topic.  Let them burn.  I can rebuild a complete Excavator, Bulldozer, Quarry Haul Truck and have all the MANY thousands of dollars to do so but I didn't have a single clue where to buy a contract of SPY, ES, S&P500, Standard and Poors 500, yet alone know they are the same thing and they come in Mini and micro.  I have Spent DAYS and DAYS watching charts and researching.  Just like you have no doubt.  I have made every Mistake, just like you have,  I still make them daily even though I know what they are.  I have learned so much from shared experiences and knowing that I will, or I have experienced the same challenges.  Quick share. I took 5k first week going live and crashed it to $900.  Turned that 900 into $8200 the next day just to go to $2400 the day after.  I have gotten my losses under control but don't have super big days. I treated it like Fun and when I got bored I would go aggressive.  Now. I just stay bored and pick cherries and when I get My $300 a day I have to FORCE myself to STOP!!  Hell, if you made it this far, Now I would like some advice.

I use Tradovate/NinjaTrader same thing.  I feel comfortable getting a good entry and following with my stop losses until I've reached my goal then walking away.  No problem, right?  Profits are Locked, Right?

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

2025-07-23 20:10:02.488793,Reddit,F,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

2025-07-23 20:10:02.489219,Reddit,ETH,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

2025-07-23 20:11:08.541074,Reddit,F,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away. 

Goodluck & NFA"

This could have major implications for the company involved (not naming the ticker here, but it may become obvious if you're following the space).

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel
* ✅ Micro-cap clean tech moonshot with upside to $1+
* ✅ Volatility = profit if you time it right

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

It's like he seemed to slip up and mention positive data before realizing he could be jumping the gun and said topline data.

""We've put a lot of work into getting this program to the point that it's at right now and we're weeks away from being able to deliver positive da-, topline data, to the market"".

It's like he seemed to slip up and mention positive data before realizing he could be jumping the gun and said topline data. 

Signs are certainly there that Phase 2 has been very positive 

And None of us big holders thinking to sell Therefore NO dip or big fall incoming :) infact more spikes up incoming...

All people I know who sold IXHL with profit are calling themselve IDIOT now :)) its just keep going up and will up more and more because a game changing drug is here incoming!!!!

2025-07-23 20:11:08.541438,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

Diamond hands only. 🦍💎🙌

2025-07-23 20:11:08.541531,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy. Actual science, major unmet need, catalyst clock ticking, and no retail hype yet. Could be one of those plays we all wish we loaded before it ran."

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.

FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news  
• Potential buyout bait if Phase 3 is confirmed  
• No major dilution or debt issues (check the filings"
2025-07-23 20:11:08.542021,Reddit,ETH,"CGTX – The Next Hidden Gem? FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

**MIAMI, FL /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ July 23, 2025 / Star8 Corporation (OTC:STRH)**, a leading technology group specializing in energy-efficient solutions and electric vehicles, is poised for transformative growth over the next 24 to 36 months, driven by its revolutionary Tomahawk DualTech System and scaled electric motorcycle production.

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**. This approach targets sectors with massive electricity requirements, including **data centers, manufacturing plants, industrial refrigeration, mining operations**, and **large-scale logistics facilities**, positioning Star8 to disrupt the global energy efficiency market.

The company is in the process of completing an ‘active' demonstration test unit that will be available for the market and any potential clients to see in ‘real-time' the incredible efficiency and cost-saving potential of implementing this technology.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

or do you do it off of the dollar move instead, like buying 50 shares of any stock regardless of the price and deciding if it moves up a dollar you take profits not caring what the percent move would be?

I have been trading for years and only decided to take profits once my target was hit to make $50 each trade, I did not care what percentage the move would have to be. I did this to keep things simple, buy 50 shares of any stock and just wait for price to go up $1."

I've never seen so much nonsense gathered in one place ever since the pump and dump days of old Twitter penny stocks. I have no idea why you guys are so divisive on pretty agreed upon things in the industry side of things. 

Like I've met institutional traders who literally only use trendlines (including myself, but I'm not an institutional trader) and yet redditors will lie and go 'the bAnKs don't trade with trendlines'. Like yes they fucking do wtf? Why do you guys do this?

Not only that, reddit just pumps the worst stocks lmao. Like just this week alone, OPEN and rkt were complete disasters lmao. I'm under the impression that there's no actual good traders on the entire website at all."

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

I have Spent DAYS and DAYS watching charts and researching.  Just like you have no doubt.  I have made every Mistake, just like you have,  I still make them daily even though I know what they are.  I have learned so much from shared experiences and knowing that I will, or I have experienced the same challenges.  Quick share. I took 5k first week going live and crashed it to $900.

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

I'm cautiously optimistic about Tesla's long-term future. How long can the company maintain its leadership position in the electric vehicle space?"

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

The next lowest ask is $110. Sarah buys only 10 shares at $110. She pays $1100, and that money goes to the seller asking for $110. However, at this point the market posts XYZ value as $110.

This what bugs me. Doesn't that mean Joe will see his portfolio has gone up 10%, and now showing $11,000, where that extra $1000 is actually just an inflated value? Until Joe sells them, and someone is willing to pay 100 shares at $110, that $1000 is not really there.

2025-07-23 20:11:08.543093,Reddit,F,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

I was around during all those meme stocks awhile back and saw the same tale tell signs, this was not going to be a long term position. What I learned during the meme frenzy was that once you start seeing the majority of the comments start talking about diamond hands this and that, is when you should start taking your profits. 

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order. The second sell order was a market stop I initiated once the stock fell and got halted, and then it sold at $3.11, pocketing a cool $23k.

Just wanted to bring some attention to Ocean Power Technologies (NYSE: OPTT) after something important was announced earlier this month on July 14. It flew under the radar for a bit, but the stock has quietly moved from around $0.50 to $0.80 since the news dropped. That’s a significant move for a sub-dollar stock and worth a second look.

🏆 ISO 9001 Certification: What It Actually Means

On July 14, OPTT announced that they’ve officially been awarded ISO 9001 certification. For anyone unfamiliar, this is a globally recognized quality standard. It means the company has documented, repeatable systems for delivering consistent, reliable products and services.

This kind of certification is often a key requirement when dealing with clients in defense, offshore energy, and scientific research. It adds another layer of legitimacy when competing for serious, long-term work.

🧩 Why It Caught My Attention

OPTT operates in the low-carbon maritime tech space. A few of their main offerings:
	•	PowerBuoy®: Provides clean offshore power and data
	•	WAM-V®: Autonomous unmanned surface vehicles
	•	Merrows™: An AI-enabled maritime awareness and monitoring platform

They’re positioning themselves at the intersection of ocean robotics, clean energy, and maritime defense. ISO 9001 doesn’t guarantee success, but it definitely helps open doors in industries that demand quality assurance.

🔎 What’s Happened Since the Announcement

A few key details:
	•	Certification announced on July 14
	•	Share price moved from roughly $0.50 to $0.80 in the days that followed
	•	Still hasn’t gotten much attention across retail channels
	•	Market cap remains below $50 million

It’s not often you see this kind of operational milestone coincide with price action, but it looks like some investors have started noticing.

Final Thoughts

Not financial advice. Just putting this out there for others who might be following the company or watching the marine tech and defense space. To me, this kind of certification says a company is investing in real systems and planning for growth."

2025-07-23 20:12:14.683302,Reddit,F,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps

2025-07-23 20:12:14.683365,Reddit,AI,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.683425,Reddit,F,"IVF stock… Provider Allegedly Destroyed Embryos Using Toxic Chemical — Lawsuit Filed Just read a breaking story on ABC News: A group of couples have filed a lawsuit against an IVF provider, alleging their embryos were destroyed after being exposed to hydrogen peroxide — a chemical that can be toxic to cells. According to the report, the plaintiffs claim the fertility lab used the solution in error, which resulted in the loss of viable embryos.

This could have major implications for the company involved (not naming the ticker here, but it may become obvious if you're following the space). If you're an investor in the fertility/biotech space, or just following developments in the IVF sector, this is worth watching closely — both from a legal and reputational standpoint.

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel
* ✅ Micro-cap clean tech moonshot with upside to $1+

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.684169,Reddit,AI,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.684255,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy.

Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

Three Ways This Plays Out

Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

⸻

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy."

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

I’m looking for free sources to get near real-time SPY option chain data (1–10 second delay is fine) for use in a trading script. I trade 0DTE SPY options and need reliable last traded prices for calls/puts without paying for subscriptions like IBKR’s OPRA. Currently using IBKR Pro with only stock data, and Yahoo Finance is too delayed (\~30min).

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.686824,Reddit,AI,"Tesla's Q2 Results: The Affordable EV & Robotaxi  What's Next for TSLA? Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

I’m aware that beating the market is difficult, but I choose individual stocks for fun.

Now, I’m looking to add about €2,000 a month and want to diversify a bit more. I realize that VOO is very tech-heavy due to its top holdings, and my hand-picked stocks are also concentrated in tech. Additionally, my portfolio is very U.S.-centric, which has been feeling a bit risky lately. I’m wondering what the more experienced investors on here would recommend in terms of diversification.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.687439,Reddit,F,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

2025-07-23 20:12:14.687559,Reddit,NIO,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

I was around during all those meme stocks awhile back and saw the same tale tell signs, this was not going to be a long term position. What I learned during the meme frenzy was that once you start seeing the majority of the comments start talking about diamond hands this and that, is when you should start taking your profits. 

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order. The second sell order was a market stop I initiated once the stock fell and got halted, and then it sold at $3.11, pocketing a cool $23k. Obviously I was hoping for more, but as soon as I saw that drop and halt, I was out."

Just wanted to bring some attention to Ocean Power Technologies (NYSE: OPTT) after something important was announced earlier this month on July 14. It flew under the radar for a bit, but the stock has quietly moved from around $0.50 to $0.80 since the news dropped. That’s a significant move for a sub-dollar stock and worth a second look.

🏆 ISO 9001 Certification: What It Actually Means

On July 14, OPTT announced that they’ve officially been awarded ISO 9001 certification. For anyone unfamiliar, this is a globally recognized quality standard. It means the company has documented, repeatable systems for delivering consistent, reliable products and services.

This kind of certification is often a key requirement when dealing with clients in defense, offshore energy, and scientific research. It adds another layer of legitimacy when competing for serious, long-term work.

🧩 Why It Caught My Attention

OPTT operates in the low-carbon maritime tech space. A few of their main offerings:
	•	PowerBuoy®: Provides clean offshore power and data
	•	WAM-V®: Autonomous unmanned surface vehicles
	•	Merrows™: An AI-enabled maritime awareness and monitoring platform

They’re positioning themselves at the intersection of ocean robotics, clean energy, and maritime defense. ISO 9001 doesn’t guarantee success, but it definitely helps open doors in industries that demand quality assurance.

🔎 What’s Happened Since the Announcement

A few key details:
	•	Certification announced on July 14
	•	Share price moved from roughly $0.50 to $0.80 in the days that followed
	•	Still hasn’t gotten much attention across retail channels
	•	Market cap remains below $50 million

It’s not often you see this kind of operational milestone coincide with price action, but it looks like some investors have started noticing.

Final Thoughts

Not financial advice. Just putting this out there for others who might be following the company or watching the marine tech and defense space. To me, this kind of certification says a company is investing in real systems and planning for growth."

2025-07-23 20:13:20.631308,Reddit,F,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away.

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel
* ✅ Micro-cap clean tech moonshot with upside to $1+
* ✅ Volatility = profit if you time it right

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.



**Degenerate DD Summary**

* ✅ Ex-Rolls-Royce CEO who knows how to scale real tech
* ✅ Government/military contracts already rolling in
* ✅ Cash-rich, debt-free, and float is small
* ✅ PowerBuoys + marine autonomy = defense/Navy ESG hype fuel
* ✅ Micro-cap clean tech moonshot with upside to $1+
* ✅ Volatility = profit if you time it right

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

Discussions around long-term offtake agreements are expected to accelerate once consistent commercial-grade output is achieved


DISRUPTING A LEGACY INDUSTRY
HPQ Silicon is advancing a breakthrough process for manufacturing fumed silica, an essential material used in cosmetics, toothpaste, food additives, and industrial products. 
Traditional production methods, unchanged since 1944, are costly, fossil-fuel intensive, and environmentally harmful. HPQ’s proprietary approach promises a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially superior alternative.

Recent production tests delivered a major leap forward, validated by independent analysis from a lab serving global fumed silica manufacturers. These results confirm HPQ’s material is within reach of commercial-grade output.

“Independent analysis confirms we are very close to commercial-grade material. It’s not just progress—it’s a leap forward,” said Bernard Tourillon, CEO of HPQ Silicon.

2025-07-23 20:13:20.632280,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

Maybe I am crazy but I see a company with dedicated backers who are doing everything they can to keep this company going. Since their IPO in 2021 they have grown and grown. They are perennially tight on cash but somehow always pull something off. Somehow they bought their competition and landed a long term deal with Amazon? It looks like their CEO is their largest shareholder and has 10s of millions invested? His last deal at Blink Charging went from 1.60 to $65?! Could he do the same thing here? IDK but Im in.

That breakout happened a few minutes after opening, $PALI pushed through and hit $1.36, giving a solid +60% opportunity.

Now the focus is on their lead product, with Phase 1b nearing completion. The question is whether any of their clinical trial data has started circulating. I can’t confirm that, but based on the recent price action, the odds seem pretty high, which could explain the reason it's been rising over 80% in the last week.

The support is currently at $1.00, with resistance around $1.10, and 1.30$.  Keep an eye on it, even though it came down 3 times when it hit 1.30$, $PALI could rally again tomorrow and reach prices of 1.60$ - 1.70$ if a 1.30$ resistance break happens. You won't get lower price than this.

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I’m not saying this is the next Amazon, but if you ever wondered what those early-stage breakout stories looked like before they took off, this has the right kind of energy. Actual science, major unmet need, catalyst clock ticking, and no retail hype yet. Could be one of those plays we all wish we loaded before it ran."

Quick recap: In early 2023, Allovir was accused by independent monitors of hiding that Allovir’s Phase 3 trials for posoleucel were unlikely to succeed. When the company terminated all three trials and revealed the negative results in December 2023, $ALVR fell by over 67%. By March 2024, Allovir faced a lawsuit from investors.

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

⸻

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy."

	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

⸻

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy."

FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**. This approach targets sectors with massive electricity requirements, including **data centers, manufacturing plants, industrial refrigeration, mining operations**, and **large-scale logistics facilities**, positioning Star8 to disrupt the global energy efficiency market.

The company is in the process of completing an ‘active' demonstration test unit that will be available for the market and any potential clients to see in ‘real-time' the incredible efficiency and cost-saving potential of implementing this technology.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

I didn't even understand what leverage or risk management was back then, I thought trading was going to be the easiest thing in the world. Since that time, trading has taken me through the darkest moments of my life and transformed me into who I am today.When I look at a trade, I’m not just looking for price action. I’m looking for the pulse beneath it, the heartbeat of the people behind the charts. It’s the same reason I’ve always been drawn to stories, to literature.

Hey everyone, I’m very new to this and just started studying about 2 months ago and haven’t even gotten to enough knowledge to trade demo yet. That said, I have every intention to keep learning and eventually back test and trade demo even if it takes years to become profitable. I’m not concerned about the time frame. My main question is: am I wasting my time watching TJR to start out? I hear a lot of mixed opinions and want to see what concepts you all trade with  or recommend learning first before I put all my faith into TJR/ICT concepts. I know to be wary of gurus and I’m reading many different books to try and diversify my learning. I know yall get this question a lot but any advice helps. 

TLDR: Are TJR/ICT concepts a waste of time to learn and if so, what do you recommend studying?"

Like I've met institutional traders who literally only use trendlines (including myself, but I'm not an institutional trader) and yet redditors will lie and go 'the bAnKs don't trade with trendlines'. Like yes they fucking do wtf? Why do you guys do this?

Not only that, reddit just pumps the worst stocks lmao. Like just this week alone, OPEN and rkt were complete disasters lmao. I'm under the impression that there's no actual good traders on the entire website at all."

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

2025-07-23 20:13:20.635744,Reddit,F,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

2025-07-23 20:13:20.636097,Reddit,ETH,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

Come Monday, this was my mindset, let the position ride up and try to make my investment back by selling half, this was the first sell order.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.402718,Reddit,F,"🚨🚀 OPTT Earned ISO 9001 Certification Earlier This Month… and Nobody’s Talking About It 🌊📈 Hey everyone. Just wanted to bring some attention to Ocean Power Technologies (NYSE: OPTT) after something important was announced earlier this month on July 14. It flew under the radar for a bit, but the stock has quietly moved from around $0.50 to $0.80 since the news dropped. That’s a significant move for a sub-dollar stock and worth a second look.

🏆 ISO 9001 Certification: What It Actually Means

On July 14, OPTT announced that they’ve officially been awarded ISO 9001 certification. For anyone unfamiliar, this is a globally recognized quality standard. It means the company has documented, repeatable systems for delivering consistent, reliable products and services.

This kind of certification is often a key requirement when dealing with clients in defense, offshore energy, and scientific research. It adds another layer of legitimacy when competing for serious, long-term work.

🧩 Why It Caught My Attention

OPTT operates in the low-carbon maritime tech space. A few of their main offerings:
	•	PowerBuoy®: Provides clean offshore power and data
	•	WAM-V®: Autonomous unmanned surface vehicles
	•	Merrows™: An AI-enabled maritime awareness and monitoring platform

They’re positioning themselves at the intersection of ocean robotics, clean energy, and maritime defense. ISO 9001 doesn’t guarantee success, but it definitely helps open doors in industries that demand quality assurance.

🔎 What’s Happened Since the Announcement

A few key details:
	•	Certification announced on July 14
	•	Share price moved from roughly $0.50 to $0.80 in the days that followed
	•	Still hasn’t gotten much attention across retail channels
	•	Market cap remains below $50 million

It’s not often you see this kind of operational milestone coincide with price action, but it looks like some investors have started noticing.

Final Thoughts

Not financial advice. Just putting this out there for others who might be following the company or watching the marine tech and defense space. To me, this kind of certification says a company is investing in real systems and planning for growth."

2025-07-23 20:14:26.402982,Reddit,F,"Belief in Rainmaker $RAKR [RAKR] Currently rocking a speculative 8,200 Shares — Weather Modification, Intriguing CEO, and Wild Upside?

I have been doing some digging and wanted to share what I’ve come across on Rainmaker Worldwide, currently trading at ~$0.145. Its piqued my interest for a few reasons.

I first came across RAKR after watching a clip from the Shawn Ryan podcast, the CEO, Augustus Doricko, was featured and came off remarkably articulate and sharp. His take on climate resilience, atmospheric water generation, and even how he handled media heat around the Texas floods showed he could both think and communicate like a serious leader. I check the podcast and videos every so often to see how many views it’s picked up. 

RAKR is positioning itself as a leader in the weather modification and atmospheric water generation space, a niche with real geopolitical and environmental tailwinds. Their aim is to create scalable, decentralized clean water solutions, and possibly more.

They’ve leaned into:
	•	Cloud seeding
	•	Atmospheric water generation (AWG)
	•	Partnerships with defense and humanitarian interests

This is a sector with limited competition and massive long-term implications particularly with rising water scarcity and climate disruption. I did some research and found China and other areas have active funding in this space. 

While there’s a fair amount of hype and skepticism around weather modification in general, what stands out is:
	•	Doricko’s composure during controversy… notably when accusations were floated regarding manipulation of weather in Texas during floods. He was eloquent, not defensive, and used it as a platform to highlight the lack of federal investment in climate tech.
	•	Small, but increasing media exposure, clips, interviews, and project previews have started circulating in niche spaces.
	•	They’re very early stage, but not hiding behind fluff. There are actual conversations happening around supply contracts, especially internationally.

Comps
	•	Many of the competitors in the space are private, government-funded, or regional agencies.
	•	RAKR’s market cap is still well under $50M, which is minuscule relative to the total addressable market for clean water, AWG, or climate engineering.

That said… asymmetric upside potential is what I’m betting on. If they pull off even a fraction of their roadmap or close a serious contract, this could re-rate hard.

Would love to hear if anyone else is in this or has been tracking it longer than I have. Bullish or bearish, I’m open to a good conversation. Just trying to make sense of it all before I potentially add more. Cash heavy so likely jumping to 10k shares tomorrow and if momentum picks up may keep chipping away. 

Goodluck & NFA"

We are tired of chasing AI stocks at $300B market caps. And here's a $25M market cap company doing military-adjacent renewable energy with z**ero debt, a Rolls-Royce exec at the helm, and contracts actually coming in**.

**Ticker: $OPTT (Ocean Power Technologies)**

**This thing is dirt cheap, fully funded, government-connected, and will moves on the earnings report.** 

# What Do They Even Do?

OPTT builds some **PowerBuoys®** — which are autonomous ocean platforms that harvest **wave energy** and power things like:

* Surveillance drones & sensors
* Offshore oil rigs
* U.S. Navy underwater vehicles
* Remote data transmission stations

They’re basically ocean-bound **Tesla batteries that float**, generate their own power from waves, and act as smart platforms.

CEO: Philipp Stratmann

* Former **VP of Strategy at Rolls-Royce** — yes, the one that makes **jet engines for Boeing and Airbus**
* Deep experience in energy transition + autonomous systems
* Left a comfy corporate job to run a micro-cap — why? **Because this s\*\*t’s got legs.**

He’s brought in:

* New government contracts
* Partnerships with defense + offshore players
* Focus on scaling revenue, not just R&D

**COO Joe DiPietro** is the ops guy making it all work, managing global deployments and defense coordination.

# Recent Momentum (a.k.a. Why This Isn’t Just a Dream)

**New Navy & defense contracts** in Q1 & Q2  
Backlog growing, *revenue increasing YoY*  
Acquired **Marine Advanced Robotics**, adding unmanned marine drones to the aresenal  
**$30M+ cash, no debt** – literal unicorn status in penny stock world  
Fell to $0.20 lows, now rebounding on **volume + contract news**

Let’s be clear: this thing was trading **above $5 in 2021** during clean energy mania. You’re buying the ashes of a SPAC-era bubble — but now with an actual business forming.

# 💸 Why us Degens Should Care

* 💣 **Tiny float, high volatility**
* 💰 **Cash > market cap** — market is pricing it like it’s dying. It’s not.
* 🏛️ **Gov contracts = recurring revenue if they play it right**
* 📡 **Defense + Clean Energy = perfect narrative mix in 2025**
* 🔥 Could 5x on hype or single big contract drop

Just **1 large defense contract or ESG media buzz**, and this thing could easily rip to $1+ short-term. That’s a **3x+ from here** with no dilution needed.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.403452,Reddit,F,"$NTCPF about to go to the stratosphere? 6-12 months if your patient enough. After a beautiful presentation today Northisle Copper and Gold offered some great insight on their project.

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left."

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

A signed Letter of Intent with the world’s largest fumed silica producer highlights industry confidence and commercial interest
Interest from additional potential partners is growing
Phase 2 testing begins in August, with expectations of producing commercial-grade material in just one or two production runs
Discussions around long-term offtake agreements are expected to accelerate once consistent commercial-grade output is achieved


DISRUPTING A LEGACY INDUSTRY
HPQ Silicon is advancing a breakthrough process for manufacturing fumed silica, an essential material used in cosmetics, toothpaste, food additives, and industrial products. 
Traditional production methods, unchanged since 1944, are costly, fossil-fuel intensive, and environmentally harmful. HPQ’s proprietary approach promises a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially superior alternative.

INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMS PROGRESS
Recent production tests delivered a major leap forward, validated by independent analysis from a lab serving global fumed silica manufacturers. These results confirm HPQ’s material is within reach of commercial-grade output.

“Independent analysis confirms we are very close to commercial-grade material. It’s not just progress—it’s a leap forward,” said Bernard Tourillon, CEO of HPQ Silicon.

OUTLOOK
HPQ is on the verge of commercial viability for its fumed silica process while setting its sights on exceeding conventional product performance.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.403946,Reddit,F,"Fuck a 10 bagger, let’s talk about a potential 100+ bagger💰💰💰 Alright listen up you degenerate gamblers. I tried writing a standard DD post before, and it got largely ignored. So I’m switching to a language I think you’ll understand.

$RDAR is sitting at $0.0009 not 9 cents. Not 0.9 cents. That’s nine one-hundredths of ONE cent. You could buy a million shares for less than your 28% interest car loan monthly payment.

Here’s where this stock is much better than your standard pump and dump garbage you normally see here:

They’re projecting $280 MILLION in revenue.
Like, actual revenue. Not vibes and vapor. Not AI buzzwords. Not “we’re launching a beta soon” energy.

This isn’t some biotech praying for FDA approval in 2036. This is a telecom + adtech company that already pulled in $300M audited revenue in 2023, hit the reset button in 2024, and now says they’re ramping back up with a $280M projection.

Oh, and they just reverse-merged with an Italian company called Mexedia SPA. Real company, real clients, listed on the Italian exchange. Not some sketchy shell with an AOL email and a logo made in MS Paint. Mexedia wanted in on the US market, bam RDAR. 

Let me hit you with some smooth-brain math:

Revenue: $280M
If it trades at a 3× Price-to-Sales (P/S) multiple, which is not crazy for a tech-ish company in growth mode, that puts the market cap at $840 million. 13x isn’t even out of the question, but I wanted to keep it realistic.

They’ve got around 5.08 billion shares, once they follow through with their announcement buyback of 1.5m of shares . Oh and they explicitly stated that there will not be a reverse split. Organic growth only here baby

So:

$840M ÷ 5.08B = $0.165 per share

It’s trading at $0.0009 right now.

That’s a 183x potential upside. Yes, you read that right. 100 bagger. Put in 1000$ get $100000+ back. 

Even if they completely bungle half the projection and only do $140M, you’re still staring at 90x upside with a 3× P/S.

And again — 3× P/S is normal for a company with recurring revenue and forward momentum. SaaS and fintech names often trade at 8–10× with zero profit.

But bro, it’s OTC?

Yeah, and that’s exactly why it’s cheap.
The second they uplist or land a partnership PR with a legit client, this wakes up hard.

Also, they just announced a $1.5M buyback. You don’t burn that kind of cash unless you think the shares are ridiculously undervalued. That reduces the float and pushes the price up mechanically.

What are the risks?

It’s still an OTC stock, institutions can’t touch it yet

Profitability needs to be proven, but they’ve hinted at it coming this year. As in “break even by Q3”

Management needs to actually act like they have shareholders and communicate. They suck at this part right now, but they’re still catching up on everything in the last year.

But if they hit even half of what they’re aiming for? This is the kind of lotto ticket with fundamentals that only shows up a few times a cycle.

TL;DR:

$0.0009 right now
$280M projected revenue
3× P/S = $0.165 target
Reverse merger with legit Italian firm
Buybacks announced
Micro float
Insane asymmetry

Buy it. Forget it. Come back in 12 months. Either you’ll be rich, or you’ll be in the same spot with a legendary story and 100M shares in your trash wallet.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.404195,Reddit,F,"Stryker's vascular business likely exceeds $2B in annual revenue and they serve the majority of hospitals in the U.S.  MBOT's novel peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a great fit. Stryker purchased Inari Medical for $4.9B in Feb 2025, expanding their vascular business by about $600M in annual revenue.

Stryker is huge in the medical space, serves most hospitals in the U.S., and is in over 100 countries, with direct sales and distributors depending on the country.  Microbot Medical's (MBOT) novel, single-use, disposable, peripheral endovascular robotic system (Liberty) would make a super addition to their portfolio, and they could launch it through their widespread existing sales channels.

Interesting note:  In Dec 2021 Stryker's neurovascular division and Microbot Medical entered into a strategic collaboration with a goal of developing the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for neurovascular interventions.

I don't know if or when it might happen, but Stryker's innovation teams look for tech like this (hence, the Inari acquisition).

The future for MBOT is exciting, and the upcoming FDA decision expected in Q3 can't come fast enough!"

2025-07-23 20:14:26.404361,Reddit,F,"$CGTX – Quiet Bio Play with Real Alzheimer’s Science and a Clock Ticking Not financial advice, just a newer trader trying to find plays with actual science behind them. I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

I have 1200 shares at $0.79 and not going to lie I have really profited yet, but im gonna hold this one for the long term. 

They’re in Phase 2 with a drug called CT1812 targeting Alzheimer’s. The latest data showed it may actually protect neurons  not just treat symptoms. That’s huge. They already dropped proteomic data showing this effect, and basically nobody’s paying attention yet. Please do your own research and although risky, i think this biotech has nothing but green flags so far.

The near-term setup is clean. They need to stay above $1 by Sept 8 to stay listed on the Nasdaq. These compliance deadlines often trigger momentum runs, especially when the float is small and volume is rising both of which are true here.

Right now it’s trading around 75 cents. Wainwright still has a $3 target on it. If this gets attention, breaks $1, and starts trending, a move to 2–3 is very realistic. That’s just on compliance and momentum.

But here’s where it gets wild if this drug keeps performing, and they land good Phase 3 data or even a partnership with a bigger pharma name, this could absolutely be a $5 to $10+ stock. Possibly way more on a buyout. Neurodegenerative drugs are a massive market, and big names are always looking to acquire pipeline-stage biotechs that show results.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.404523,Reddit,F,"Deadline for Getting Payment on Allovir $1M Investor Settlement Is Next Month If you missed it, Allovir (now part of Kalaris) finally agreed to settle with investors over hiding issues with the effectiveness of its lead product, Posoleucel, and the deadline for getting payment is next month.



Quick recap: In early 2023, Allovir was accused by independent monitors of hiding that Allovir’s Phase 3 trials for posoleucel were unlikely to succeed. When the company terminated all three trials and revealed the negative results in December 2023, $ALVR fell by over 67%. By March 2024, Allovir faced a lawsuit from investors.



Now they’re paying them a $1M settlement. And the deadline is next month, August 19. So, if you were damaged by this, you can [check if you’re eligible](https://11th.com/cases/allovir-investor-settlement) and file a claim to get payment.



Anyways, did anyone here invest in $ALVR back then? How much were your losses if so?"

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy."

2025-07-23 20:14:26.405190,Reddit,F,"CGTX – The Next Hidden Gem? FDA Milestone Just Hit, P3 & Buyout Potential Looming 👀💥 Over the past few weeks, **Cognition Therapeutics ($CGTX)** has been flying under the radar… but that could change **very soon**. I’ve done my DD, and here’s why this stock could be on the verge of a major breakout — potentially even a **buyout** — especially if FDA news plays out.

Oh, and for the record, the last time I posted about $OPEN before its rally, it went up **400%**. 👀

⸻

🧠 1. **Alzheimer’s Treatment with Real Momentum – CT1812**

CGTX is developing *CT1812*, a drug for Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies — **two massive markets** with very few effective treatments. On **July 9, 2025**, the company completed its **End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA**, a pivotal moment in any biotech’s path.

They expect **formal meeting minutes in August**, which will provide a clear roadmap for **Phase 3 trials** and their eventual **NDA (New Drug Application)** submission. If the FDA gives them the green light for pivotal trials, we could be looking at **major upside**.

⸻

📊 2. **Low Float + Micro Cap = Explosive Potential**

This is a **sub-$100M market cap** stock trading under $1 — with a low float. Just a bit of positive momentum (whether it’s results, a partnership, or a buyout) could send this thing **flying**. We’ve seen this pattern play out with other biotech names time and time again.

⸻

💊 3. **Strategic FDA Positioning + CNPV Qualification**

If CGTX times their Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and labeling submissions right after a green light from the FDA, they could qualify for **CNPV (Critical Need Product Voucher)** — a rare and highly valuable designation that big pharma LOVES.

This could *significantly boost* their value in a buyout scenario.

⸻

💸 4. **Buyout Potential? Don’t Sleep on It.**

Big pharma is **desperate** for promising Alzheimer's assets. With Biogen's recent troubles and Eli Lilly’s push in this space, any company with a promising molecule in Phase 3 territory becomes **prime acquisition material**.

If CGTX gets a buyout at even **$5–$10/share**, you’re looking at **multi-bagger territory** from here. I personally averaged in at $0.60 — and I’m still adding.

⸻

📈 So Why CGTX, and Why Now?

This is not just a gamble — this is **timing and fundamentals colliding**:

• Late-stage clinical Alzheimer’s candidate with positive signals  
• Completed critical FDA Phase 2 meeting — minutes due soon  
• Low float + sub-$1 microcap = massive upside on news  
• Potential buyout bait if Phase 3 is confirmed

**MIAMI, FL /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ July 23, 2025 / Star8 Corporation (OTC:STRH)**, a leading technology group specializing in energy-efficient solutions and electric vehicles, is poised for transformative growth over the next 24 to 36 months, driven by its revolutionary Tomahawk DualTech System and scaled electric motorcycle production.

**Tomahawk DualTech System: A Game-Changer for Energy Efficiency**

The Tomahawk DualTech System, developed by Star8's subsidiary TOMAHAWK SRL, is a patent-pending technology that optimizes motor and mechatronic performance, slashing energy consumption and heat waste while boosting operational efficiency. Designed for high-energy-demand industries, DualTech's innovative business model offers **zero-cost installation** for clients, with Star8 earning **10% of the energy cost savings**. This approach targets sectors with massive electricity requirements, including **data centers, manufacturing plants, industrial refrigeration, mining operations**, and **large-scale logistics facilities**, positioning Star8 to disrupt the global energy efficiency market.

The company is in the process of completing an ‘active' demonstration test unit that will be available for the market and any potential clients to see in ‘real-time' the incredible efficiency and cost-saving potential of implementing this technology.

We have also secured our 1^(st) commercial client in the Australian wine Industry, in the Riverina region of NSW. The client has a large vineyard farm that is drip irrigated by 4 large 3 phase electric motors. The average electricity costs of $100K AUD per month. Our aim is to reduce these costs by 20-40%.

Star8 Corp will be compensated with a 10% of the savings, on an ongoing basis.

$100K AUD ($65,453 USD) Current Average Electricity Usage

30% $30K AUD ($19,636USD) Projected saving average

$3K AUD ($1,963USD) Payment to Star8 Corp on a average monthly basis

CEO Gianluca Scarponi said: ""The demonstration unit and 1^(st) commercial client are very important for proof on concept. This will demonstrate the enormous efficiency and power saving capabilities of the DualTech System technology""

**Scaling Motorcycle Sales: High-Margin Growth**

Scarponi Motorcycles has strengthened its position in the electric vehicle (EV) market with a $5 million purchase order for 300 motorcycles annually, for 3 years. (900 motorcycles in total announced Jan. 7, 2025).

The first motorcycles for this Canadian contract are expected to leave in July 2025. The 300 motorcycles for 2025 will scale through the rest of the year.

We are experiencing organic growth in the Italian and EU markets with sales steadily increasing as well.

**Corporate Changes**

The company has made several corporate changes over the last 90 days including appointing new accountants, corporate attorneys and new auditors.

To this end, we have applied to FINRA for a name change and ticker symbol change.

A name change has already been approved by the State of Delaware from Star8 Corp. to TOMAHAWK Inc.

We have engaged our new auditor to complete PCBAOB audits, with a view to up list to the OTCQB status. We expect to have this application filed in August 2025."

If by tomorrow night I am alive the plan is the same next morning. To all the traders out there struggling with what ever part of this game, know that this shit is literally going face to face with your own demons, addictions and behavior that actually doesn’t let you grow being fear and green the big bosses… and defeat those demons is the biggest challenge because they appear daily, but! each time you win that day by following what you said you was going to the demons become weaker, keep winning.

Huh now reading this I guess I got I little exited lol but what I wanna to ask was if someone had a situation like that, that even knowing you can do it laziness wins and what was the click their did in their mind to change that? To me was the finding out what I really wanted from life, nothing material just to be the best I can each day

or do you do it off of the dollar move instead, like buying 50 shares of any stock regardless of the price and deciding if it moves up a dollar you take profits not caring what the percent move would be?

I have been trading for years and only decided to take profits once my target was hit to make $50 each trade, I did not care what percentage the move would have to be. I did this to keep things simple, buy 50 shares of any stock and just wait for price to go up $1."

I've never seen so much nonsense gathered in one place ever since the pump and dump days of old Twitter penny stocks. I have no idea why you guys are so divisive on pretty agreed upon things in the industry side of things. 

Like I've met institutional traders who literally only use trendlines (including myself, but I'm not an institutional trader) and yet redditors will lie and go 'the bAnKs don't trade with trendlines'. Like yes they fucking do wtf? Why do you guys do this?

Not only that, reddit just pumps the worst stocks lmao. Like just this week alone, OPEN and rkt were complete disasters lmao. I'm under the impression that there's no actual good traders on the entire website at all."

Since coming back to trading after a break, I’m basically starting from scratch and only able to use cash for my trades. Honestly, it feels like I’m crawling while everyone else is driving.

Right now, with Fidelity, I’m stuck using cash and limit orders—so no market orders for me. Because of that, I keep missing out on great trades, especially those that move fast. It's so frustrating because I know what I’m doing, I can spot the patterns, but actually executing trades feels like trying to type with mittens on.

I’ve never really cared for all the technical and procedural stuff behind the scenes. At one point, I tried to find an accountant to help with all that, me being an autistic ADHD trader, but there was nobody taking clients that I could speak with ""in-person"" near me, and it just added to my stress. Plus, there were so many voices chiming in: “Don’t move that much at once,” “Form an LLC,” “Do a sole proprietorship”… it was a little overwhelming. Eventually I had a breakdown because I came from poverty and had money, people wanted to spend it, invest their money with me for ""quick cash"" so I let it all go. I donated, let contracts expire worthless, sold at a loss, etc... (Imposter syndrome + depression at the time)

Now that I’m trading again, not having margin stings way more than I expected. Not being able to jump into trades or get orders filled quickly—yeah, it’s rough. And sure, I could just limit buy at the ask to get fills easier, but that feels risky because of the spreads and me buying a contract or something for more than it's worth while things are moving.

Anyone else out there get this? Or maybe someone has a workaround to make this a little less painful? Would love to hear how others manage or if there’s something I’m missing."

I can rebuild a complete Excavator, Bulldozer, Quarry Haul Truck and have all the MANY thousands of dollars to do so but I didn't have a single clue where to buy a contract of SPY, ES, S&P500, Standard and Poors 500, yet alone know they are the same thing and they come in Mini and micro.  I have Spent DAYS and DAYS watching charts and researching.  Just like you have no doubt.  I have made every Mistake, just like you have,  I still make them daily even though I know what they are.  I have learned so much from shared experiences and knowing that I will, or I have experienced the same challenges.  Quick share. I took 5k first week going live and crashed it to $900.

I treated it like Fun and when I got bored I would go aggressive.  Now. I just stay bored and pick cherries and when I get My $300 a day I have to FORCE myself to STOP!!  Hell, if you made it this far, Now I would like some advice.

I use Tradovate/NinjaTrader same thing.  I feel comfortable getting a good entry and following with my stop losses until I've reached my goal then walking away.  No problem, right?  Profits are Locked, Right?

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Here is my Problem.  If I am in say 15 Micro on MGC, set my STOP and LIMIT for 15 right..If I hit the LIMIT I take profit all is good right?  Until it comes back up/down and hit the stop loss.  Then it BUYS/SELLS 15!!!  That could get really bad!  AM I stupid and missing something that is extremely simple and obvious to prevent this?"

I have learned so much from shared experiences and knowing that I will, or I have experienced the same challenges.  Quick share. I took 5k first week going live and crashed it to $900.

I treated it like Fun and when I got bored I would go aggressive.  Now. I just stay bored and pick cherries and when I get My $300 a day I have to FORCE myself to STOP!!  Hell, if you made it this far, Now I would like some advice.

I use Tradovate/NinjaTrader same thing.  I feel comfortable getting a good entry and following with my stop losses until I've reached my goal then walking away.  No problem, right?  Profits are Locked, Right?

But, Sometimes I see a set up,  BUY/SELL (CALL/PUT) (GO high/GO low) (see the problem as a newbie?)  Then I position my Stop Loss and would like to put a take Profit LIMIT at say a 1 to 3 RR and walk away.

Here is my Problem.  If I am in say 15 Micro on MGC, set my STOP and LIMIT for 15 right..If I hit the LIMIT I take profit all is good right?  Until it comes back up/down and hit the stop loss.  Then it BUYS/SELLS 15!!!  That could get really bad!  AM I stupid and missing something that is extremely simple and obvious to prevent this?"

Tesla’s second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there’s the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla’s CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years.

Here’s how the company performed compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.09 adjusted vs. $3.57 expected
* **Revenue**: $3.22 billion vs. 3.12 billion expected

Subscription revenues, which account for the majority of the enterprise technology company’s revenues, hit $3.11 billion and topped a $3.03 billion forecast from StreetAccount.

The company boosted its full-year subscription revenue guidance to between $12.775 billion and $12.795 billion as it benefits from artificial intelligence adoption.

“Every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI,” said ServiceNow chairman and CEO Bill McDermott in a release.

Net income grew 47% to $385 million, or $1.84 per share, from $262 million, or $1.26 per share a year ago. Revenues grew nearly 23% to about $3.22 billion.

ServiceNow said it anticipates a 2 percentage point hit to current remaining obligations in the third quarter due to seasonality and more customers renewing contracts in the final quarter of the year. The company also said budget changes at U.S. government agencies could impact results.

“While federal business is a bit uncertain today versus a year ago, we’re navigating it well, and we feel confident that our guidance reflects any potential changes that we’re seeing,” finance chief Gina Mastantuono told CNBC.

In its 2024 annual earnings report, ServiceNow said one U.S. federal government customer accounted for 11% of revenues.

During the first quarter, its public sector business grew 30%, McDermott said during the last reporting period.

Subscription revenues are expected to range between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, ahead of a $3.21 billion estimate from StreetAccount. Current remaining performance obligations rose nearly 25% to $10.92 billion in the quarter.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM’s revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a statement. Growth in the first quarter was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit’s gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount’s 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation z17 mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

As of Wednesday’s close, IBM shares were up 28% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained around 8% in the same period.

2025-07-23 20:14:26.407495,Reddit,F,"Chipotle trims same-store sales forecast as fewer diners visit its restaurants Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday cut its forecast for same-store sales growth this year after traffic declined for a second straight quarter.

The burrito chain now anticipates flat same-store sales growth for 2025, down from its prior projection of a low-single digit percentage increase. Chipotle trimmed its same-store sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

Here’s what the company reported for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted, in line with expectations
* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

Chipotle’s net sales rose 3% to $3.06 billion, thanks to its new restaurants. But the company’s same-store sales shrank 4%, steeper than last quarter’s decline of 0.4% and StreetAccount estimates of a 2.9% decrease for the second quarter. Average check increased roughly 1%, partially offsetting traffic declines of 4.9%.

Last year, Chipotle outpaced the rest of the restaurant industry, bucking a trend of sluggish sales and traffic declines. But by the end of December, the company started seeing softer sales, which executives chalked up to the timing of Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Then came bad weather in January, including wildfires in California, and a broader consumer pullback in February.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call, CEO Scott Boatwright said diners’ concerns about the economy led them to skip restaurant visits and save their money instead.

Chipotle reported second-quarter net income of $436.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding impairment charges, legal costs and other items, the company earned 33 cents per share.

Chipotle reiterated its forecast that it would open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

While it is still a subject of debate, tokenization's potential to drastically reshape the investing landscape has drawn strong interest.
It is being touted as the next breakthrough for bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance, with supporters saying it could open up an asset class that has long been out of reach for retail investors.

The growing interest in tokenization coincides with the renewed optimism in the crypto industry, which has rallied in recent months and gained momentum after the Genius Act was passed earlier this month.
Critics, however, say tokenization could allow companies to bypass the guardrails put in place to protect retail investors.

As I understand it, please correct me if wrong, gold tends to work inversely to how the economy is faring, and to central bank interest rates being lowered/increased.

My worry is that somehow the losses/earnings of one will cancel the other's earnings/losses, i.e. gold fares well because the market is tanking. So whatever I earn in the gold ETF I will lose in the all-world ETF.

What would you do? Thank you so much."
